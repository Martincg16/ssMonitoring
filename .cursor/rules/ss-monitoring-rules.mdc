#Context
I am developing a solar system monitoring app. The app is based on Django. The purpose of the app is to bring data from solar inverters and save it on the database.

#Rules
1. If a question is asked, never write code. Only provide the answer to the question and wait for the instruction to code.
2. Always explain your reasoning, never assume the coder knows the answers.

- You can @ files here
- You can use markdown but dont have to
