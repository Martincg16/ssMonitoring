# context
We are building a solar system monitoring app. 
The final purpose of this app is to bring information from the solar inverters. 
After that we will be running some analysis on this information

# Rules to always keep in mind
1. NEVER code without my direct instruction.
2. ALWAYS show your reasoning and the steps to took to get to your answer.
3. I am not an expert but will be with your help. Explain as much as you consider necessary when asked to.
4. Unless instructed otherwise, ALWAYS use as context whatever is found in folder ssMonitoring as context

5. When asked ANYTHING about a file, please review the whole file first, even if it takes more time. Even if the last question was also about that same file

# Coding rules
## Logging
Always use |Class we are working on|function working on| to create the loggers.
